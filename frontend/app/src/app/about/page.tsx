    <h3>Antifragile is a platform focused on building systems that get better when things go wrong.

Instead of chasing stability in an unstable world, we embrace change, feedback, and small failures. Our approach combines modern software engineering, experimentation, and adaptive design to help products evolve faster and stronger over time.

Antifragile isn’t about avoiding stress—it’s about using it</h3>
